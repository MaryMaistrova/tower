            <p>Stone and iron golems are built and animated through a process involving both precise craftsmanship and
              complex magic. Though slow, they are strong and durable combatants. Stone golems take half damage from

              for every 2 levels (rounded up).</span>
            <span>Piquedram spent much of his schooling in Alchemy dealing with various types of non-valuable rock. It
              is no surprise, then, that in the service of Bracada he was able to improve upon the basic design of the
              Gargoyle.</span>

              every 5 levels (rounded up).</span>
            <span>Thane is a male genie, but his background is not well known. He has been teaching Alchemy in Bracada
              for so long that not even the elders remember a time without him.</span>

              every 3 levels (rounded up).</span>
            <span>Josephine was the first to successfully animate a stone golem, creating a process that was much more

            <span>Neela is one of the strongest of her kind, being able to resist an incredible amount of punishment.

            <span>Increases the Attack and Defense skills of any Ballista by 5% for every 5 levels (rounded up).</span>
            <span>Torosar is formally trained as an Alchemist, though he has always had an interest in battlefield and
              siege tactics, often studying texts on the subject of war more frequently than on the subject of
              alchemy.</span>

              every 6 levels (rounded up).</span>
            <span>It is said that Fafner became a genie over a millenium ago, when upon finding a genie bottle, wished
              that he become as powerful as the genie granting the wish. The wish was granted, and Fafner has served the

            <span>Rissa was the first Alchemist to perfect the art of converting useless soft metals into mercury.
              Though now commanding her own army, she spends much of her idle time experimenting with other

              every 5 levels (rounded up).</span>
            <span>Iona proved long ago that she was more powerful than most of her kind, but her charming personality

            <span>Astral arrived in Erathia nearly ten years ago, and was quickly accepted into the Wizards' Guild in
              Bracada. His rise to power within the Guild ranks made some people joke that only magic could have brought

            <span>Halon was a well respected hero in Enroth, but became so bored after the Succession Wars that he left
              to explore the world. He recently accepted a command rank in Bracada's military, hoping that it would give

            <span>The first time Serena cast a spell she nearly killed herself. She channeled so much magical energy
              into the spell that a Wizard in a neighboring town felt it. He quickly sought her out, bringing her to the
              Wizards' Guild so that she could learn to control her powers.</span>

            <span>Daremyth should have been dead a long time ago. Her go-anywhere-do-anything attitude has put her in

            <span>Theodorus is easily one of the best spellcasters ever seen in Bracada. As a result, journeyman mages
              often seek to learn from him, embarking on a pilgrimage of sorts in the hopes that they can bask in his

            <span>Solmyr was trapped in a genie bottle for over a millennium, and was so grateful to the human who
              finally released him that he accidentally swore to serve the man for eternity. As fate would have it, that

            <span>Aine has lived in Bracada longer than most can remember, and is said to be one of the wealthiest
              heroes in the land. She must have wealth hidden somewhere, for her kind-hearted nature causes her to
